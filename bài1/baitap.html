    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Have a nice day !</p>
    <h2>keshi - like i need u (lyrics)</h2>
    <p>
    	<pre>
    		(baby i call in the dead of night
		but you don’t need me like i need you
		pray that i won’t be alone)
		layin on the bed
		waitin for your text (be alone)
		babe there’s nothin left
		faded im a wreck (be alone)

		afraid what’s coming next
		wished we never met (be alone)
		laying us to rest but
		baby i beg you (be alone)

		2 soon (like i need you)
		with the drunk call (pray that i won’t be alone)
		in the middle of the night you
		took it, my fault (be alone)
		didn’t really mean to interrupt (be alone)
		but if u change ur mind then hit me up (be alone)

		pain, that’s an option
		no time for nonsense
		can’t ask you nothing
		drank, feeling nausous
		too many toxins
		not even conscious
		say nothin more, say nothin more baby

		we’re better on our own
		tonight im getting throwed (you don’t need me)
		she never coming home 
		stay with me (pray that i wont be alone)
		say you’ll leave (you don’t need me)
		(be alone)

		(baby girl is saying that we just friends, that we just friends
		if we fuckin are we just friends, are we just friends)﻿
